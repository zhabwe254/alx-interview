"Minimum Operations" problem:

Environment:

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python 3.4.3


File requirements:

End with a new line
Start with #!/usr/bin/python3
Follow PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
Must be executable


Documentation:

README.md file required
Code should be documented


Task: Minimum Operations

Function: def minOperations(n)
Input: Integer n
Output: Minimum number of operations (integer)
Operations: "Copy All" and "Paste"
Goal: Achieve exactly n 'H' characters
Return 0 if n is impossible to achieve


Algorithm hint:

Consider prime factorization
Optimal solution involves factors of n


Example provided:

n = 9, result = 6 operations


Testing:

Main file provided for basic testing



To approach this problem:

Analyze the pattern for different values of n
Consider prime factorization of n
Implement the minOperations function
Test with provided examples and additional cases
Optimize for efficiency if needed
